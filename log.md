# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a FreeCodeCamp challenge, "Reverse a String"

**Thoughts**: It wasn't too difficult. The tips given were String.prototype.split(), String.prototype.reverse() String.prototype.join(); which made it quite easy to follow the logic. I came out with the solution quite fast. I had one significant mistake though. That is, I totally forgot that i'm working on a string, not an array, meaning I forgot to turn the string into an array first. That lead me to think, why I need split(), I can directly reverse()?
