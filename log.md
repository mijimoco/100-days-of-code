# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Days 0-5: January, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I'm following my challanges at FreeCodeCamp. I forgot to take log of the first five days, but basically what I was doing was to follow the challanges at FCC as I mentioned.

**Thoughts:** So far I've really enjoyed FCC and this #100daysofcode challenge very much. I wish I won't fall behind in the next 100 days.

I also enjoyed using github, I'm just getting used to working with it.



### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a FreeCodeCamp challenge, "Reverse a String"

**Thoughts**: It wasn't too difficult. The tips given were String.prototype.split(), String.prototype.reverse() String.prototype.join(); which made it quite easy to follow the logic. I came out with the solution quite fast. I had one significant mistake though. That is, I totally forgot that i'm working on a string, not an array, meaning I forgot to turn the string into an array first. That lead me to think, why I need split(), I can directly reverse()?

### Day 7: January 10, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Keep working on FreeCodeCamp challenges, today I fixed Palindrome Challenge, where we are supposed to write a function which would check whether a string is a palindrom. Function should clean any non-alphanumeric characters first.

**Thoughts:** This was a fairly easy challenge, though I learned a lot using methods related with String objects. Also I feel much relaxed now, as the first week concludes at #100daysofcode challenge, to work with codepen.io or github
